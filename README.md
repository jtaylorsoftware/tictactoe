# Overview

This project provides packages for running a Tic-tac-toe server using either TCP or HTTP+WebSockets. 

Its communication protocol uses space-separated and newline-terminated strings with a single word header and N fields (command dependent).

See [tictactoe-client](https://github.com/jeremyt135/tictactoe-client) for a python GUI client implementation.
