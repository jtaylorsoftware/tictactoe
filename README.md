# Overview

This project provides packages for running a Tic-tac-toe server using either TCP or HTTP+WebSockets. 

It uses a text protocol consisting of a single line of space-separated tokens, where the first token is the command
and the rest are arguments to the command.

See [tictactoe-client](https://github.com/jtaylorsoftware/tictactoe-client) for a python GUI client implementation.
